osgART ChangeLog.
=================


Changes in version 2.0 
------------------------------------

To clearly mark the new generation of osgART we needed to break the API completely. osgART is now more
versatile beyond tradition Augmented Reality application development.




Changes in version 1.1 (2007-04-11).
---------------------------------------------------
Although osgART functionality remains similar, version 1.1 includes major architectural changes over version 1.0.
- The ARToolKit tracker is now self-contained in a plugin, allowing different versions of ARToolKit (open source v2.x vs. Professional v4.x, NFT) to be used, as well as other tracker libraries.
- Video plugins now return frames in the standard osg::Image type, allowing video to be more easily utilised elsewhere in the scene graph.
- Tracker plugins now accept the standard osg::Image type.
- Connection of the video and the tracker is achieved using a new OSG node type, ARSceneNode, which is subclassed from osg::Group, eliminating the need for a separate run loop inside osgART.
- The video background functionality has been restructured, eliminating some small utility classes in favour of achieving the same effect with standard OSG calls.
- Passing of data to and from the video and tracker plugins is now managed through fields, dynamically typed accessors which allow for plugins to accept and supply a variety of different data types.


Changes in version 1.0 (2006-12-18).
------------------------------------
All platforms:
- The structure of osgART has been significantly reorganised during the beta release process. If you were participating in the beta test program, we recommend that you carefully examine the examples for correct usage patterns.
- A large number of examples have been added to the project. Enjoy!
- osgART now has a plugin structure for video sources and tracking libraries. osgART Standard Edition comes with default plugins for ARToolKit 2.72's libARVideo video library and libAR tracker library.
